# A little Insight Into Gilbert Adikankwu
Hi Everyone! My name is Gilbert Adikankwu and I am `Python`-Dev, Data Analyst and Blockchain enthusiast. This README with give you a bit of information about me.

## My Career Passions
I really love working Data. Specifically, I love being in a position where I can help others get insights from data and make informed decisions! Whether that's being a Data Analyst using __Jupyter notebook__ and `Python` libraries like `Pandas` and `Numpy` to clean and analyze datasets, a programmer writing `Python` scripts that can generate, clean and store data in a database,  or using __Excel__ to create reports and dashboard visualizations for Business owners and Executives, thats my sweet spot! I enjoy Learning and researching for hidden details, so any role that enables me to flex my analytics muscles is the right role for me, that is why I really enjoy working on datasets!

## My Hobbies
One of my favorite thing to do is listen to Rap music- even if i can't rap to save my life lol, just listening to the rhyming of words on the complex beats and feeling the vibe is enough for me. I also love reading about famous innovators and playing car racing video games, need for speed is my favourite.
